# slave.js
A selfhost package for my Slave discord bot. If you're intrested in making commands yourself, you can check out [SlaveArchitecture.](https://github.com/p2js/slavearchitecture)

## features
- xp system
- moderation suite (kicks, bans, warns, reports, mutes)
- plenty of utility commands

## setup
requires node.js already installed on your computer.
- open your [discord apps](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and create a bot app
- copy the invite link into botconfig.json
- copy the token into botconfig.json
- copy your own user id into botconfig.json
- in the folder where the files are contained, install discord.js with `npm i discord.js` and in your terminal.
- now type in `node index.js` and your bot should be up and running.
- the default prefix is set to `^`, so type in `^help` and the command list should appear.

This bot will not be updated anymore. I have abandoned this project almost completely.
